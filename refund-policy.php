                        <h3>Refund Policy Of YouStable</h3>
                        <p>1. If paying via credit card, debit card, net banking, PayPal the account will be set up
                            immediately once the payment is confirmed. </p>
                        <p>2. The 30-day money-back guarantee is only applicable for first-time signups. Second time and
                            subsequent sign-ups are not eligible for the same. For instance, if you've had an account
                            with us before, cancelled and signed up again, you will not be eligible for a refund or if
                            you have opened a second account with us.</p>
                        <p>3. Refund is not applicable on domain registration/transfer/renewal, Control Panel,
                            LiteSpeed, Softaculous, Cloud, VPS, Dedicated Server, Paid Support, SSL Certificates,

                        <p>4. The modifications done in pricing pattern or policy by the software license company will
                            take effect immediately on YouStable clients.</p>
                        <p>5. The money-back-guarantee is provided on Shared hosting, WordPress hosting .</p>
                        <p>6. No refund will be made if your Service(s) are suspended or terminated for cause.</p>
                        <p>7. There is a limitation of every hosting platform. On an OpenVZ VPS, GUI is not supported
                            and it won’t be possible to upgrade the kernel or change the BIOS setting. Kernel upgrade is
                            possible on KVM Cloud instances but you cannot change the BIOS settings. You won't be
                            eligible for a refund in such cases.</p>
                        <p>8. The refund will not cover any kind of taxes, setup fees, refund processing fee, postal
                            charges or any kind of payment processing charges or bank fee(s). There will be no refunds
                            issued in case the web hosting account was involved in violation of our terms of service or
                            any kind of illegal or system resources over-usages or after 30 days period or beyond the
                            coverage of our refund policy as noted here.</p>
                        <p>9. <strong>Shared Hosting</strong></p>
                        <p>DaStart, DaElite, DaProfessional: 1 free domain is offered with the purchase of every new
                            plan for 1/3 years. You may transfer your existing domain under this offer. The domain name
                            will be free for the first year and renewal charges will be applicable from the second year.
                        </p>
                        <p>10. You must add the domain name to your cart with the hosting plan. You cannot claim the
                            free domain later.</p>
                        <p>11. If the web hosting service includes a free domain name, and you cancel the web hosting
                            service, the domain charges (standard rate as per website) would be deducted from the refund
                            amount. If the refund amount is less than the domain name price, you will have to pay the
                            difference or forfeit the domain. The ownership of the domain will remain with YouStable if
                            you fail to pay the difference amount.</p>
                        <p>12. Transfer fees would be applicable if you wish to transfer the free domain name to some
                            other provider. Without transfer fees, the domain will not be released.</p>
                        <p>13. The refund request placed after 30 days will not be processed and you will not be
                            eligible for any refund.</p>

                        <p>15. After submitting the cancellation request, we will check if you meet the refund criteria.

                            that offers this feature, and your domain renewal is processed through this method, then in
                            that case, we are not responsible for issuing any refund. Please ensure that you are aware
                            of your billing and auto-debit settings.</p>
