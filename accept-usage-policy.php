                        service. Violation of this AUP may result in suspension or termination of your service. In the

                        YouStable's interpretation, in its reasonable commercial judgment, shall govern.</p>

                    <p><i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> The following is the entire Acceptable User Policy
                        ("AUP") agreement between YouStable and the personal or corporate account holder. YouStable
                        provides managed web hosting and domain name service. YouStable has certain legal and ethical
                        responsibilities consisting of the use of its servers and equipment involved in these services.
                    </p>

                    <p><i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> YouStable's general policy is to act as a provider of
                        Internet presence. YouStable reserves the right to suspend or cancel a customer's access to any

                    <h5>What is Appropriate Usage?</h5>

                    <p><i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> YouStable web hosting solution has specifically been
                        designed to serve the web hosting needs of small and independently owned and operated businesses
                        and organizations throughout the world.</p>

                    <p><i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Since you will be hosting your website with several
                        other clients on our servers in a virtual community, our offerings are not intended to support
                        enterprise-level or large company requirements. For that, we recommend purchasing at least a
                        virtual private server, dedicated server solution.</p>

                    <p><i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> YouStable hosting is a shared web hosting service,
                        which ultimately means several customers' websites are hosted within the same server
                        environment. To ensure that our hosting is first-class, reliable, and available to all customers
                        within that server community, an individual customer's website usage cannot adversely affect the
                        performance of other customers' sites.</p>

                    <p><i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> We monitor our servers 24/7/365 and in no way can one
                        customer adversely affect the performance of that server. If this happens, we will take
                        preventative measures to ensure that the entire community is protected.</p>

                    <p><i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Lastly, our web hosting service is intended to host
                        websites, not backup or storage facility for users' data. Using your web hosting account
                        primarily as an online storage space for archiving electronic files and images is strictly
                        prohibited. Our servers are for web hosting usage only.</p>
